# text: ## Getting Started
# text: It is not necessary to clone or download the whole repository. This library uses [Simple DOSBox Client](https://github.com/rarioj/sdc) to process the `Library.txt` configuration file. Refer to SDC's [Host Requirements](https://github.com/rarioj/sdc#host-requirements) section for all the required and recommended tools. A [`Setup`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup) script from SDC and a [`Library.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/plong/main/Library.txt) configuration file from this repository are all you need. Steps to follow:
# text:
# text: 1. Create an empty library directory.
# text: 2. Download the latest `Library.txt` configuration file and the latest `Setup` script.
# text: 3. Make the `Setup` script executable.
# text: 4. Run the `Setup` script.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: mkdir plong
# text: cd plong
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/plong/main/Library.txt" -o Library.txt
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup" -o Setup
# text: chmod a+x Setup
# text: ./Setup
# text: ```
# text:
# text: 5. Once the library is ready, go to the desired game directory.
# text: 6. Run the `Launch` script and enjoy the game.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: cd "Games/By Genre/Adventure/Beneath a Steel Sky"
# text: ./Launch
# text: ```

# text: ## Is this legal?
# text: The purpose of this repository is to share a plain-text library configuration file. None of the program assets, such as floppy disks, CD-ROM images, zipped archives, and game manuals, are hosted here. I do not take any responsibility if downloading and running old programs (applications, tools, operating systems, and games) is considered illegal in certain countries. I do not condone the act of software piracy or copyright infringement.
# text:
# text: Some of the old programs listed here are **Freeware** (free to use and distribute), **Abandonware** (no longer being distributed or supported by the developer or copyright holder), **Discontinued** (end-of-life software), and some are **Proprietary** (software is still available for purchase). Please try to buy the program first from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), or other online stores. Each program in the library, especially those tagged as *Proprietary*, will include external links to buy online.
# text:
# text: All program assets are available from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). It is possible, however, that some assets are no longer downloadable. Please submit an issue if that is the case. I asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) about the legality of playing old DOS games downloaded from the Internet Archive.
# text:
# text: > ❝ The legality of playing old DOS games downloaded from Archive.org depends on the specific circumstances and the copyright status of the particular game in question.
# text: >
# text: > In general, it is illegal to download and play copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner. However, some older games, especially those made for MS-DOS, are now considered abandonware, which means that the copyright owner may no longer exist or may not be enforcing their rights to the game. In such cases, it may be legal to download and play the game.
# text: >
# text: > It's important to note that the legality of abandonware is a grey area, and there is no clear consensus on whether it is legal or not. If you're concerned about the legality of playing a specific game, you may want to consult a lawyer or do some research to determine the copyright status of the game.
# text: >
# text: > In general, it is a good idea to respect the rights of copyright owners and to only play games that you have legally obtained. ❞ — ChatGPT

You'll begin with the playing pit, a 3-D enclosure with length, width, and depth that you can set. During the game, various 3-D blocks will fall. Rotate and maneuver each block into the proper position to form complete layers. As each layer completes, it vanishes, giving you more points and more room to work. Blockout will challenge your reflexes and resolve in a test of coordination and quick thinking. But the greatest challenge of all will be keeping yourself from playing it again, and again, and again.

Unravel a plot as twisted as the catacombs you will be wandering. As an American in Paris, George Stobbart, you find it odd when an accordion-playing clown darts out of a cafe clutching a briefcase. Moments later, a force of massive explosion sent you flying right into a sinister world of intrigue. What are the coveted contents of that briefcase? A fiercely guarded manuscript penned by a clandestine medieval order - the Knights Templar. Steal it back before a group of Megalomaniacs fathoms its mysteries and overturns the very balance of life.

The main character is a courier making an emergency delivery by a jet pack to one of Genoq's top researchers, Jean-Paul Derrida, who is oblivious to the events inside the building until the lab's doors lock behind him after he enters. His point of delivery is ten floors away, all of them crawling with bioweapons.

Climbing the darkened stairway, he found that alien beings had invaded the HQ and killed all humans - including his wife and children!

Spending all his insurance money, Jacek underwent many costly operations giving him superhuman strength and senses. He armed himself with weapons and set out for the conquered station. Jacek is unaware that the aliens have rebuilt the station with numerous security systems built to keep him out. Can you help our hero?

Hi-Octane puts you behind the wheel of an armour-plated Hov-Car capable of 400+mph. Race through city streets, open wastelands or deserts faster than a Ferrari and with accessories you'd never find on a Volvo (like a missile launcher and chain gun). If anyone gets in your way, remember your highway code: Mirror. Signal. Fire!

# file: All Programs/Games/Jagged Alliance/Program.txt = # info: The island of Metavira is invaluable as the only known source of the Fallow tree, whose sap is a vital ingredient in a precious medicinal sap. As the tree is seedless and cannot reproduce, the limited quantity of sap is of great concern. Jack and Brenda Richards, a father and daughter scientist team, are dedicated to researching the delicate procedure necessary to tap the trees and finding a cure for its infertility. Lucas Santino, a once trusted fellow researcher, now traitorous, has his agenda. Motivated by greed, Santino seeks to control the only source of the Fallow tree's sap and has nearly succeeded in taking over the island. Jack and Brenda turn to you, a person with connections to A.I.M. (the Association of International Mercenaries), their only hope of regaining control of the island.

If you want to get ahead in the competitive corporate corridors of WAR, you need to master the use of human-assisted robots (HARs). These gigantic robots’ purposes include defence and controlling far-flung planetary outposts. The next outpost up for colonization is Jupiter’s moon Ganymede. The highly-paid job as pilot of the WAR representative will compete fiercely, and you must qualify for the position by proving your worth in the arena. It will be the grandest one-on-one combat since the Roman Era.

As Mayor, you have the tools to overcome any challenge. Whether taxes, zoning, crime, transportation, fire control, pollution, natural disasters, or other critical issues, the duties of the Mayor are yours.

# file: All Programs/Games/The Settlers/Program.txt = # info: Have you always wanted to be a boss? Then you should not save until you can afford a mini-state. Let yourself into the world of The Settlers. You alone decide how you shape your empire, how big your settlement will be, and whether you will calmly limit yourself to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing; or start the industrial revolution. Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets! Listen to the chirping of birds and the rush of the wind, the pounding of the waves and the clash of steel swords.

Shooting down UFOs is just the beginning. You lead a squad of heavily-armed soldiers across different terrains as they investigate the UFO crash site. Tackle the aliens with automatic rifles, rocket launchers and even tanks in the struggle to retrieve useful technology, weapons or life forms. Successful ground assault missions will allow XCom scientists to analyse alien items. Each breakthrough brings you closer to understanding the technology and culture of the alien races. When your engineers have amassed sufficient research data on their superior weapons and craft, they'll be available for your troops.

# file: All Programs/Games/X-COM - Apocalypse/Program.txt = # info: Human excess, petty conflict, and alien invasion have ravaged the Earth. The world's population has merged into huge cities, the first of which was Mega Primus. In 2084, a Utopia shattered, social collapse and civil unrest reigned in Mega Primus. Fiendish aliens terrorise the city. UFOs swarm through Dimensional Gateways. The city is under siege from an unknown enemy. As an X-COM Commander, your mission is to combat alien aggression and uncover their deadly intentions. But Beware! Alien infiltration into the city and its politics could see you under fire from criminal gangs, religious sects, and even the police!

# file: All Programs/Games/X-COM - Terror from the Deep/Program.txt = # info: Awakened by the cosmic emissions of their brothers, the vast chambers of innumerable species begin their re-animation cycle. XCom must face a new terror, an army of aliens but in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on men in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world and use new technology. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares. A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the vessel T'leth crash-landed on Earth some sixty-five million years ago, the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons, computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt colonisation, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite.
