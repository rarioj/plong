# text: ## Getting Started
# text: It is not necessary to clone or download the whole repository. This library uses [Simple DOSBox Client](https://github.com/rarioj/sdc) to process the `Library.txt` configuration file. Refer to SDC's [Host Requirements](https://github.com/rarioj/sdc#host-requirements) section for all the required and recommended tools. A [`Setup`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup) script from SDC and a [`Library.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/plong/main/Library.txt) configuration file from this repository are all you need. Steps to follow:
# text:
# text: 1. Create an empty library directory.
# text: 2. Download the latest `Library.txt` configuration file and the latest `Setup` script.
# text: 3. Make the `Setup` script executable.
# text: 4. Run the `Setup` script.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: mkdir plong
# text: cd plong
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/plong/main/Library.txt" -o Library.txt
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup" -o Setup
# text: chmod a+x Setup
# text: ./Setup
# text: ```
# text:
# text: 5. Once the library is ready, go to the desired game directory.
# text: 6. Run the `Launch` script and enjoy the game.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: cd "Games/By Genre/Adventure/Beneath a Steel Sky"
# text: ./Launch
# text: ```

# text: ## Is this legal?
# text: The purpose of this repository is to share a plain-text library configuration file. None of the program assets, such as floppy disks, CD-ROM images, zipped archives, and game manuals, are hosted here. I do not take any responsibility if downloading and running old programs (applications, tools, operating systems, and games) is considered illegal in certain countries. I do not condone the act of software piracy or copyright infringement.
# text:
# text: Some of the old programs listed here are **Freeware** (free to use and distribute), **Abandonware** (no longer being distributed or supported by the developer or copyright holder), **Discontinued** (end-of-life software), and some are **Proprietary** (software is still available for purchase). Please try to buy the program first from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), or other online stores. Each program in the library, especially those tagged as *Proprietary*, will include external links to buy online.
# text:
# text: All program assets are available from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). It is possible, however, that some assets are no longer downloadable. Please submit an issue if that is the case.
# text:
# text: > #### I asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) about the legality of playing old DOS games downloaded from the Internet Archive.
# text: >
# text: > ❝ The legality of playing old DOS games downloaded from Archive.org depends on the specific circumstances and the copyright status of the particular game in question.
# text: >
# text: > In general, it is illegal to download and play copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner. However, some older games, especially those made for MS-DOS, are now considered abandonware, which means that the copyright owner may no longer exist or may not be enforcing their rights to the game. In such cases, it may be legal to download and play the game.
# text: >
# text: > It's important to note that the legality of abandonware is a grey area, and there is no clear consensus on whether it is legal or not. If you're concerned about the legality of playing a specific game, you may want to consult a lawyer or do some research to determine the copyright status of the game.
# text: >
# text: > In general, it is a good idea to respect the rights of copyright owners and to only play games that you have legally obtained. ❞ — ChatGPT

# file: All Programs/Games/Alone in the Dark/Program.txt = # info: A suspicious suicide. A chilling curse. A malevolent power. And a wicked dark secret. You are in Derceto, a legendary Louisiana mansion - where, against your better judgement, you're drawn into a world of shadows to explore the darker side of Jeremy Hartwood's imagination. Despite a paralyzing sense of personal danger, your quest for truth drives you to investigate the old house. By entering Derceto, you are entering the daily nightmare of Jeremy Hartwood's life. You will be facing the torturous howls that resound deep within its halls. You didn't foresee the shadowy corridors that seemingly have no end. You couldn't anticipate the brooding, gloom-filled rooms, the pervasive weight of dread, and the heavy sense of evil filling the atmosphere and the house itself.

Shot down in the region of the infamous Bermuda Triangle, our hero has crash-landed into a dense tropical jungle and a whole heap of trouble. Are you a god? It is more than divine intervention to fend off attacks from restless natives and ferocious dinosaurs, save a distressed damsel from a fate worse than death, and escape this insanity to return home. There's no time to party. Sharp reflexes and lateral thinking are essential if Jack is to escape from this land that time doesn't even know about. It is not a holiday resort.

Unravel a plot as twisted as the catacombs you will be wandering. As an American in Paris, George Stobbart, you find it odd when an accordion-playing clown darts out of a cafe clutching a briefcase. Moments later, a force of massive explosion sent you flying right into a sinister world of intrigue. What are the coveted contents of that briefcase? A fiercely guarded manuscript penned by a clandestine medieval order - the Knights Templar. Steal it back before a group of Megalomaniacs fathoms its mysteries and overturns the very balance of life.

# file: All Programs/Games/Call of Cthulhu - Shadow of the Comet/Program.txt = # info: The year is 1910. Bathed in pale Spring sunlight, the small fishing port of Illsmouth is a sleepy New England town where time seems to stand still. Appearances can be very deceiving, however. Beneath the peaceful tranquillity of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers. Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley Comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one speaks of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients.

Guerrilla strategies and savage combat are the norms. In the hyper-real combat/strategy experience of Command & Conquer, you're thrust dead-on into the heat of an all-out race for global control. Will you side with the humanistic Global Defense Initiative? Or bring the world to its knees with the terroristic Brotherhood of Nod? Decide fast. Your adversaries are without mercy. Spread your web of power via electronic and physical aggression. Build bases, muster forces and lacerate your enemies to the bone. All for the love of power.

A creature who once served as Diablo's chief minion and ally, Na-Krul and his cohorts rebelled against Diablo and, after a failed attempt to overthrow their master, were banished to the Void. Freed by an evil sorcerer, Na-Krul has set up command in the ancient Demon Crypts and has once again started his plans to destroy Diablo and spread the evils of Hell throughout the world. Gathering together a small army of never-before-seen monsters, Na-Krul poses an even more threat than Diablo.

# file: All Programs/Games/Discworld/Program.txt = # info: You will find wizards, dragons, heroes, and household hygiene specialists. There is danger here, but there is also custard around the place. Discworld is a fantasy world with a low reality threshold. The real world keeps on breaking through, but Discworld changes it. However, because it is a fantasy world, there are some things that it has to have, and one of them is a certain tendency to experience some trouble with dragons. Unfortunately, a dragon is now ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the world's leading city. Many people consider this a civic improvement, but Ankh-Morpork needs a hero. All they have, however, is Rincewind, a wizard whose only talent is that he is not, in fact, dead yet. He also has the Luggage, the nastiest piece of travelware in the universe. With that at his side, there is probably no limit to things he can fail to do. Oh, did I say he? I meant you.

Climbing the darkened stairway, he found that alien beings had invaded the HQ and killed all humans - including his wife and children! Only his friend Placek remained, and together they escaped to another planet. Now, it is time for revenge. Spending all his insurance money, Jacek underwent many costly operations, giving him superhuman strength and senses. He armed himself with weapons and set out for the conquered station. Jacek is unaware that the aliens have rebuilt the station with numerous security systems built to keep him out. Can you help our hero?

# file: All Programs/Games/Gobliiins/Program.txt = # info: Can you help the Good King regain his sanity before you lose yours forever? Your mission is to track down the dark force abusing the Good King's voodoo doll. Find them, stop them, and usher in an era of peace and prosperity. Simple, huh? Wrong! Gobliiins is a warped and wonderful quest, filled with level after level of truly twisted objects, inventory, and logic puzzles. You command Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo, three eager imps with specific skills. Hooter casts spells. Dwayne can pick objects up and use them. BoBo has a mean right hook. Individually, they're no match for the dark force, but together, they're still no match. That's where you come in.

Two countries ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the maze. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the labyrinth guardian died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd fell under some curse. A goblin reporter named Blount gets caught amid these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf, falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.

# file: All Programs/Games/Hexen - Beyond Heretic/Program.txt = # info: While you were battling the evil forces of D'Sparil, the other Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in alternate dimensions. One such dimension is the decaying world where Hexen takes place. A world littered with the mangled corpses of nonbelievers and inhabited by the undead followers that executed them. Only three humans: a warrior, a mage, and a cleric - have escaped the leaders' vicious spell. Three brave souls have the sword to crush the evil regime that threatens to destroy the world forever.

# file: All Programs/Games/Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis/Program.txt = # info: Plato knew about Atlantis. In a lost dialogue, he wrote about the famed city and orichalcum, the mysterious element that powered the Atlanteans' stunning machinery. The Nazis know about Atlantis. They tracked down the lost dialogue and realized orichalcum would yield them the ultimate weapon of the age. Sophia knows about Atlantis. She unearthed a mysterious necklace and beads of orichalcum during an Icelandic archeological dig with Indy. Their magical properties made her a psychic. Everyone knows except Indy, and he has got to learn fast. The Nazis are one step ahead of him - from Iceland to North Africa and the Azores to Atlantis.

Now, Adolph Hitler is after the most powerful talisman of all - the Holy Grail. A few brave men stand in his way. Fortunately, one of them is Indiana Jones, and he has his dad with him. The bad guys are in your face - mercenaries, traitors, and spies. Not to mention everything the Luftwaffe can throw at you. Can you handle the heat? If you can, you might earn a higher IQ (Indy Quotient) than the man with the whip and the hat.

# file: All Programs/Games/Jagged Alliance/Program.txt = # info: The island of Metavira is invaluable as the only known source of the Fallow tree, whose sap is a vital ingredient in a precious medicinal sap. As the tree is seedless and cannot reproduce, the limited quantity of sap is of great concern. Jack and Brenda Richards, a father and daughter scientist team, are dedicated to researching the delicate procedure necessary to tap the trees and find a cure for infertility. Lucas Santino, a once trusted fellow researcher, now traitorous, has his agenda. Motivated by greed, Santino seeks to control the only source of the Fallow tree's sap and has nearly succeeded in taking over the island. Jack and Brenda turn to you, a person with connections to AIM (Association of International Mercenaries), their only hope of regaining control of the island.

His burning desire to possess the precious Kyragem slowly drove him to slay the peaceful King William. As the rightful prince of Kyrandia, you must pursue the elusive Malcolm to recover the powerful gemstone. Only then will you be able to reclaim the throne and restore harmony to the land of Kyrandia. The Legend of Kyrandia awaits you.

And though it initially had beneficial uses, the quest for it made the lands barren. Worse, many corrupt wizards began turning to mana for their nefarious purposes, eventually leading to war. The battling wizards began using more destructive spells and summoning deadly monsters, which often turned against them. One wizard hoped to end everything with an all-powerful magic spell but instead only left the worlds shattered. Only his apprentice survived. His goal is to restore the world to equilibrium.

If you want to get ahead in the competitive corporate corridors of WAR, you need to master the use of human-assisted robots (HARs). These gigantic robots' purposes include defence and controlling far-flung planetary outposts. The next outpost up for colonization is Jupiter's moon Ganymede. The highly-paid job as pilot of the WAR representative will compete fiercely, and you must qualify for the position by proving your worth in the arena. It will be the grandest one-on-one combat since the Roman Era.

Her Uncle Fred, the family's scientist, has scrambled colonial America into one big hysterical, historical omelette! The British are about to win the war this time unless you can set the facts straight! If you want help with this sticky situation, talk to Ben Franklin, but be careful! Uncle Fred's confused him, too! You'll have to help Ben out, or the world will never know Ben. You'll be amazed by his wisdom and cracked up by his sense of humour! It is too much for one kid to handle, so Pepper brought some backup - her mischievous mutt, Lockjaw. You'll get to play as a dog! Do all the doggie things you've always wanted to try. Sniff out mysteries. Dig holes. Chew things up. BITE PEOPLE!

Underneath you, the springs of an institutional cot sink almost to the floor. The mattress is roughly the thickness of a paper towel and reeks of affliction. Vague memories assault you, a hurried phone call, a message of utmost importance, and a car losing control. As you wake up with a throbbing head, you hear people screaming, sobbing, laughing manically in the background. Is it a nightmare? Are you insane? Is it a reality? Maybe this is death.

# file: All Programs/Games/SimCity/Program.txt = # info: Shake hands, kiss babies and do not let monsters destroy your city! So you want to be Mayor? Well, now is your opportunity! Begin with empty land, start a town, name it after yourself, and build it into a city. See if you can sustain enough growth to expand your city into a megalopolis! As Mayor, you have the tools to overcome any challenge. Whether taxes, zoning, crime, transportation, fire control, pollution, natural disasters, or other critical issues, the duties of the Mayor are yours. For a change of pace, try saving a city burdened with problems by playing one of the eight built-in scenarios. Time is passing, and every decision you make has future consequences - so get to work!

Expand by adding more floors, more offices and elevators. Then diversify to hotel rooms, shops, theatres, restaurants, condos and more as you build your way to the top. Success in SimTower requires design talent, management skills, business acumen and the ability to keep your customers happy. And be on the lookout for fires, insect infestations, terrorists and more (you will find out soon enough).

# file: All Programs/Games/Terminal Velocity/Program.txt = # info: In the far future, armadas from surrounding systems have suddenly waged war on Earth, destroying critical installations and major cities. Earth is now on its knees. You are a pilot from the Ares Squadron flying the fastest, most dangerous crafts ever made. Currently, you are in the TV-202, a fighter few can handle. Given that the previous model, the TV-101, has chalked up more dead pilots than any experimental craft in history, many consider you lucky to be alive. You are in a flying coffin, outgunned and outmanned. But think how good a Saved-the-Known-Galaxy title will look on your resume.

# file: All Programs/Games/Tex Murphy - Martian Memorandum/Program.txt = # info: It's 2039, six years after solving the Linsky murder case. The years have been less than kind to Tex Murphy. In post-holocaust San Francisco, he has been into constant radiation, but what's put the lines in his face are the years trying to stay afloat and recapture the glory of his first big case. While working on his first case, Tex stumbled into - and foiled - a conspiracy to dominate the world. Since then, he's been high and dry, trying to keep from being broke. Understandably, he jumps at an offer by the powerful Marshall Alexander.

# file: All Programs/Games/Tex Murphy - Mean Streets/Program.txt = # info: It's the year 2033. Your name is Tex Murphy, a private investigator in San Francisco. A beautiful daughter of a university professor hired you to uncover the facts about her father's death. As the investigation begins, you expose the deaths of several prominent scientific community members. Are these deaths coincidental? Or is there something more sinister going on? And which characters could have a motive? Could it be J. Saint Gideon, the former head of British Intelligence? Could Frank Schimming, the President of the world's largest surveillance firm, be hiding something? Or what about Sylvia, the professor's daughter? Is she as innocent as she seems? And why is an infamous Detroit hitman in town?

# file: All Programs/Games/Tex Murphy - Under a Killing Moon/Program.txt = # info: In December 2042, Tex Murphy, the last of the old-style PIs, hit rock bottom. From the shadowy back streets of post-apocalyptic San Francisco come rumours that an ancient evil, foretold by prophecy and worshipped by an ancient blood cult, has mysteriously reawakened. Hired to find the stolen statuette, he plunged into a labyrinth of deceit, manipulation, and murder. He will need his PI instincts and every ounce of his savoir-faire to resist the seduction of darkness and stop the forces of evil - before the terrifying prophecies turn into reality.

# file: All Programs/Games/The Dig/Program.txt = # info: An asteroid the size of a small moon is on a crash course toward Earth, and only NASA veteran Boston Low has the expertise to stop it. Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink. Once the wayward asteroid is in a safe orbit, they examine the asteroid's rocky surface. What they uncover is anything but routine. Low, Brink, and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The spacecraft transported them across the galaxy to a desolate planet, Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels. But no Cocytans. Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich-empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unravelling in the face of such uncertainty? To return to Earth, they must dig for answers on the planet's surface and deep within themselves.

# file: All Programs/Games/The Gene Machine/Program.txt = # info: It is the age of England. Under the stern rule of Queen Victoria, the British Empire was expanding throughout the globe, bringing the bright light of civilization to the darkest reaches of the wild. Wherever there is poverty and heathen ritual, wherever people drop their H's or don't take afternoon tea, there is at least one garrison of Her Majesty's Army ready to shoot anyone with bare feet. It is a time of adventure and discovery. It is the most exciting of times. Those born to the correct families can look forward to working at the forefront of modern technology as the world succumbs to the power of steam.

# file: All Programs/Games/The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes - The Case of the Serrated Scalpel/Program.txt = # info: London, 1888. Scotland Yard summoned Sherlock Holmes, the world's most famous private investigator, and his faithful companion, Dr Watson, to the scene of a gruesome crime - A young actress was found dead in an alley behind her theatre. Not surprisingly, Scotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade is clueless. Was it the work of the Ripper? Sherlock Holmes is unsure, as the circumstantial evidence indicates a much more intricate crime. The shrewd detective begins the hunt.

# file: All Programs/Games/The Settlers/Program.txt = # info: Have you always wanted to be a boss? You should not save until you can afford a mini-state. Let yourself into the world of The Settlers. You alone decide how you shape your empire, how big your settlement will be, and whether you will calmly limit yourself to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing - or start the industrial revolution. Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets! Listen to the chirping of birds and the rush of the wind, the pounding of the waves and the clash of steel swords.

As a British secret agent on a vital mission, it is up to you to change the course of history as you explore the world's most luxurious ocean vessel in all its original splendour. Navigate the amazingly detailed 3D reconstruction of the doomed ocean liner and rub elbows with high society from the turn of the century, searching for clues and solving challenging puzzles that could alter world history.

# file: All Programs/Games/X-COM - Terror from the Deep/Program.txt = # info: Awakened by the cosmic emissions of their brothers, the vast chambers of innumerable species begin their re-animation cycle. XCom must face a new terror: an army of aliens in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on men in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world and use new technology. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares. A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the vessel T'leth crash-landed on Earth some sixty-five million years ago, the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons, computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt colonization, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite.

# file: All Programs/Systems/Windows 98SE/Program.txt = # info: Windows 98 (codenamed Memphis) is a graphical operating system by Microsoft. It is the second major release in the Windows 9x line of operating systems. Released to manufacturing on May 15, 1998, and to retail on June 25, 1998, Microsoft planned to discontinue its support for Windows 98 versions on January 16, 2004. However, due to its popularity, Microsoft maintained support until July 11, 2006. Windows 98 is no longer available from Microsoft in any form due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems.
