> ❝ The island of Metavira is invaluable as the only known source of the Fallow tree, whose sap is a vital ingredient in a precious medicinal sap. As the tree is seedless and cannot reproduce, the limited quantity of sap is of great concern. Jack and Brenda Richards, a father and daughter scientist team, are dedicated to researching the delicate procedure necessary to tap the trees and finding a cure for its infertility. Lucas Santino, a once trusted fellow researcher, now traitorous, has his agenda. Motivated by greed, Santino seeks to control the only source of the Fallow tree's sap and has nearly succeeded in taking over the island. Jack and Brenda turn to you, a person with connections to A.I.M. (the Association of International Mercenaries), their only hope of regaining control of the island. ❞

Once the wayward asteroid is in a safe orbit, they examine the asteroid's rocky surface. What they uncover is anything but routine. Low, Brink, and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The spacecraft transported them across the galaxy to a desolate planet, Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels. But no Cocytans. Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich-empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unravelling in the face of such uncertainty? To return to Earth, they must dig for answers on the planet's surface and deep within themselves. ❞

Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets!
