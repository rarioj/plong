> ❝ Inside a seedy, dilapidated bar in San Fransisco, your dreams of escape are about to be realized. But remembering one last keepsake, magic suddenly seized you, and your transformation begins. You emerge as a cockroach from within the damp walls of Eddie's bar. Enter a world of perilous puzzles and bizarre perspectives. What you discover may shock you. What you don't may kill you. Either way, you won't come out the same person. You may not even come out as a person at all. ❞

> ❝ You are Jack J. Thompson. Destiny has brought you here. It's 1942. Shot down in the region of the infamous Bermuda Triangle, our hero has crash-landed into a dense tropical jungle and a whole heap of trouble. Are you a god? It is more than divine intervention to fend off attacks from restless natives and ferocious dinosaurs, save a distressed damsel from a fate worse than death, and escape this insanity to return home. There's no time to party. Sharp reflexes and lateral thinking are essential if Jack is to escape from this land that time doesn't even know about. It is not a holiday resort. ❞
