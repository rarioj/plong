Then diversify to hotel rooms, shops, theatres, restaurants, condos and more as you build your way to the top. Success in SimTower requires design talent, management skills, business acumen and the ability to keep your customers happy. And be on the lookout for fires, insect infestations, terrorists and more (you will find out soon enough). ❞<br> |
