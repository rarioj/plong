> ❝ Before you lie the promise that is the New World with all its peril and infinite possibility. Vast, lush green tracts of forest; freezing, crystal clear mountain rivers; plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Be its master! Colonization from Sid Meier is a story of discovery, exploration and territorial independence. Play the colonist, conquistador and diplomat facing the challenges and frustrations of building a new independent nation. Choose the European power you want to represent: French, Spanish, Dutch, or British. Use the wealth of the land to build up your position. Use deceit and force to outwit rivals. Use trade alliances to forge friendships and create new industries - all while holding back the possibility of revolt. ❞

Then you raised taxes (and lost 10 points), read two local newspapers, built a zoo, a marina and a library, and pushed your education bill through the city council.

> ❝ Have you always wanted to be a boss? You should not save until you can afford a mini-state. Let yourself into the world of The Settlers. You alone decide how you shape your empire, how big your settlement will be, and whether you will calmly limit yourself to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing - or start the industrial revolution. Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets! Listen to the chirping of birds and the rush of the wind, the pounding of the waves and the clash of steel swords. ❞
