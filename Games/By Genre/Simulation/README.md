> ❝ Shake hands, kiss babies and do not let monsters destroy your city! So you want to be Mayor? Well, now is your opportunity! Begin with empty land, start a town, name it after yourself, and build it into a city. Then see if you can sustain enough growth to expand your city into a megalopolis! As Mayor, you have the tools to overcome any challenge. Whether taxes, zoning, crime, transportation, fire control, pollution, natural disasters, or other critical issues, the duties of the Mayor are yours. For a change of pace, try saving a city burdened with problems by playing one of the eight built-in scenarios. Time is passing, and every decision you make has future consequences — so get to work! ❞

> ❝ Reach for the sky! Start by building a small office complex - a lobby, a few offices and a cafe. Expand by adding more floors, more offices and elevators. Then diversify to hotel rooms, shops, theatres, restaurants, condos and more as you build your way to the top. Success in SimTower requires design talent, management skills, business acumen and the ability to keep your customers happy. And be on the lookout for fires, insect infestations, terrorists and more (you will find out soon enough). ❞
