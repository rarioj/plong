> ❝ Shake hands, kiss babies and do not let monsters destroy your city! So you want to be Mayor? Well, now is your opportunity! Begin with empty land, start a town, name it after yourself, and build it into a city. Then see if you can sustain enough growth to expand your city into a megalopolis! As Mayor, you have the tools to overcome any challenge. Whether taxes, zoning, crime, transportation, fire control, pollution, natural disasters, or other critical issues, the duties of the Mayor are yours. For a change of pace, try saving a city burdened with problems by playing one of the eight built-in scenarios. Time is passing, and every decision you make has future consequences — so get to work! ❞

> ❝ This morning, you approved a new solar power plant, designed an underground transportation system, and jumped five points in the polls. Then you raised taxes (and lost 10 points), read two local newspapers, built a zoo, a marina and a library, and pushed your education bill through the city council. It's time for lunch - unless there's a fire, tornado, earthquake or alien invasion. ❞

> ❝ Reach for the sky! Start by building a small office complex - a lobby, a few offices and a cafe. Expand by adding more floors, more offices and elevators. Then diversify to hotel rooms, shops, theatres, restaurants, condos and more as you build your way to the top. Success in SimTower requires design talent, management skills, business acumen and the ability to keep your customers happy. And be on the lookout for fires, insect infestations, terrorists and more (you will find out soon enough). ❞

> ❝ Have you always wanted to be a boss? Then you should not save until you can afford a mini-state. Let yourself into the world of The Settlers. You alone decide how you shape your empire, how big your settlement will be, and whether you will calmly limit yourself to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing; or start the industrial revolution. Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets! Listen to the chirping of birds and the rush of the wind, the pounding of the waves and the clash of steel swords. ❞
