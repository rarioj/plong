> ❝ Enter the corrupt racing world of Death Rally, where defensive driving means annihilating your opponents. You'll become ravenous for the power and glory of being the best at Death Rally, but first, you must pay your dues. Put the pedal to the metal and smash, blast and obliterate the competition to earn the chance to face the undefeated master, "The Adversary." Make deals with loan sharks and mob bosses to get the cash you need to build the ultimate battle racing machine. Remember, no trick is too dirty, and no spectator is too innocent - in your savage quest for the checkered flag. ❞

> ❝ Racers drive to their death on the bleak streets of the 21st century. Hi-Octane puts you behind the wheel of an armour-plated Hov-Car capable of 400+mph. Race through city streets, open wastelands or deserts faster than a Ferrari and with accessories you'd never find on a Volvo (like a missile launcher and chain gun). If anyone gets in your way, remember your highway code: Mirror. Signal. Fire! ❞
