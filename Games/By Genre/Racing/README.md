> ❝ Enter the corrupt racing world of Death Rally, where defensive driving means annihilating your opponents. You'll become ravenous for the power and glory of being the best at Death Rally, but first, you must pay your dues. Put the pedal to the metal and smash, blast and obliterate the competition to earn the chance to face the undefeated master, "The Adversary." Make deals with loan sharks and mob bosses to get the cash you need to build the ultimate battle racing machine. Remember, no trick is too dirty, and no spectator is too innocent - in your savage quest for the checkered flag. ❞

> ❝ Racers drive to their death on the bleak streets of the 21st century. Hi-Octane puts you behind the wheel of an armour-plated Hov-Car capable of 400+mph. Race through city streets, open wastelands or deserts faster than a Ferrari and with accessories you'd never find on a Volvo (like a missile launcher and chain gun). If anyone gets in your way, remember your highway code: Mirror. Signal. Fire! ❞

> ❝ This race is so full of sound and fury, so graphic and realistic that you will squirm in your seat as you squeal around futuristic 3-0 cities in custom war wagons loaded with weapons. You'll have so much fun so fast it will make your head spin. Remember, your life depends on speed, cunning, and aggression. And you're going to need them all. You can't avoid tricky scum like Hammerhead and King Kool as their gangs try to take you out. But if you knock them off first, you can grab their guns and get going on the ride of your life. It's do or die. You haven't seen anything like this because there's never been anything like MegaRace. Strap yourself into this brave new world of battle racing and take it to the limit! ❞

> ❝ Lights blur. The crowd whizzes past. Your helmet rattles against the roll bar. The competition switches into overdrive. Tears stream from your eyes as the race moves at extreme speed. The same stuff seeps out of your palms and onto the steering wheel. Get a grip. You are sliding into a turn at 200 miles per hour. Centrifugal force will only carry you so far. It is a velocity-driven, pedal-to-the-metal arcade auto racing. No simulation. Find out how your PC handles because you have never been allowed to go this fast. Maneuver through a twisted landscape, along six snaking tracks with other racers breathing down your neck, and post a warped time. Strapped into a personally chosen, made-for-the-autobahn racing machine, you will scream to redefine fast in this winding 3-D ride of pure rocketing fun. ❞
