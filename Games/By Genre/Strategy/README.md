Colonization by Sid Meier is a story of discovery, exploration and territorial independence. Play the colonist, conquistador and diplomat facing the challenges and frustrations of building a new independent nation. Choose the European power you want to represent: French, Spanish, Dutch, or British. Use the wealth of the land to build up your position. Use deceit and force to outwit rivals. Use trade alliances to forge friendships and create new industries - all while holding back the possibility of revolt. ‚ùû

> ‚ùù This morning, you approved a new solar power plant, designed an underground transportation system, and jumped five points in the polls. Then you raised taxes (and lost 10 points), read two local newspapers, built a zoo, a marina and a library, and pushed your education bill through the city council. It's time for lunch - unless there's a fire, tornado, earthquake or alien invasion. ‚ùû

> ‚ùù In the distant future, a small group of human exiles are fighting for survival on the galaxy's edge. A unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace through military strength, espionage, and deceit. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations are looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbours, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species, the Zerg, has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come. As the military leader for your species, you must gather the resources you need to train and expand your military and lead them to victory. ‚ùû

> ‚ùù Have you always wanted to be a boss? You should not save until you can afford a mini-state. Let yourself into the world of The Settlers. You alone decide how you shape your empire, how big your settlement will be, and whether you will calmly limit yourself to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing - or start the industrial revolution. Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets! Listen to the chirping of birds and the rush of the wind, the pounding of the waves and the clash of steel swords. ‚ùû

> ‚ùù Awakened by the cosmic emissions of their brothers, the vast chambers of innumerable species begin their re-animation cycle. XCom must face a new terror: an army of aliens in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on men in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world and use new technology. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares. A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the vessel T'leth crash-landed on Earth some sixty-five million years ago, the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons, computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt colonization, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite. ‚ùû
