It's a sport that tests the core of your being. Spirit, heart, desire, strength and stamina are all stretched beyond their breaking points and then asked to go just one more round. ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing is far more than the typical punching games. Our detailed attention to creating a premier simulation and role-playing environment delivers a knock-out gaming combination that challenges the rest. ‚ùû
