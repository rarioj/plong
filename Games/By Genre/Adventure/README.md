> ‚ùù The year is 1910. Bathed in pale Spring sunlight, the small fishing port of Illsmouth is a sleepy New England town where time seems to stand still. Appearances can be very deceiving, however. Beneath the peaceful tranquillity of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers. Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley Comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one speaks of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients. ‚ùû

> ‚ùù You will find wizards, dragons, heroes, and household hygiene specialists. There is danger here, but there is also custard around the place. Discworld is a fantasy world with a low reality threshold. The real world keeps on breaking through, but Discworld changes it. However, because it is a fantasy world, there are some things that it has to have, and one of them is a certain tendency to experience some trouble with dragons. Unfortunately, a dragon is now ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the world's leading city. Many people consider this a civic improvement, but Ankh-Morpork needs a hero. All they have, however, is Rincewind, a wizard whose only talent is that he is not, in fact, dead yet. He also has the Luggage, the nastiest piece of travelware in the Universe. With that at his side, there is probably no limit to things he can fail to do. Oh, did I say he? I meant you. ‚ùû

> ‚ùù An asteroid the size of a small moon is on a crash course toward Earth, and only NASA veteran Boston Low has the expertise to stop it. Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink. Once the wayward asteroid is in a safe orbit, they examine the asteroid's rocky surface. What they uncover is anything but routine. Low, Brink, and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The spacecraft transported them across the galaxy to a desolate planet, Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels. But no Cocytans. Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich-empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unravelling in the face of such uncertainty? To return to Earth, they must dig for answers on the planet's surface and deep within themselves. ‚ùû
