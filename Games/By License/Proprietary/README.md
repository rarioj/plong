> ❝ Can you help the Good King regain his sanity before you lose yours forever? Your mission is to track down the dark force abusing the Good King's voodoo doll. Find them, stop them, and usher in an era of peace and prosperity. Simple, huh? Wrong! Gobliiins is a warped and wonderful quest, filled with level after level of a truly twisted object, inventory, and logic puzzles. You command Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo, three eager imps with specific skills. Hooter casts spells. Dwayne can pick objects up and use them. BoBo has a mean right hook. Individually, they're no match for the dark force, but together, they're still no match. That's where you come in. ❞

Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink. Once the wayward asteroid is in a safe orbit, they examine the asteroid's rocky surface. What they uncover is anything but routine. Low, Brink, and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The spacecraft transported them across the galaxy to a desolate planet, Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels. But no Cocytans. Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich-empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unravelling in the face of such uncertainty? To return to Earth, they must dig for answers on the planet's surface and deep within themselves. ❞

XCom must face a new terror, an army of aliens but in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on men in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world and use new technology. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares. A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the vessel T'leth crash-landed on Earth some sixty-five million years ago, the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons, computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt colonization, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite. ❞
