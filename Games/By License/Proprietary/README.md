As the tree is seedless and cannot reproduce, the limited quantity of sap is of great concern.

You alone decide how you shape your empire, how big your settlement will be, and whether you will calmly limit yourself to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing; or start the industrial revolution. Your geologists will only be able to tell you where to find ore, coal or gold. It is in your hands to place mines, steel factories and toolmakers, thus stimulating trade within your empire. Have sentry huts, towers or garrisons built to protect yourself from the enemy knights. Gain new lands. Perhaps behind the mountain pass in the north lies a fertile valley where your fishermen can lay out their nets!

XCom must face a new terror, an army of aliens but in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on men in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world and use new technology. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares. A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the vessel T'leth crash-landed on Earth some sixty-five million years ago, the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons, computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt colonisation, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite. ‚ùû
