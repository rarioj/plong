# Future Wars: Adventures in Time

「**Future Wars: Time Travellers**」「**Time Travelers: The Menace**」

> ❝ In the 43rd century, Earth is under attack by an alien race. The planet is well-protected by a formidable SDI defence that the aliens cannot penetrate. Until they hit on a plan, sabotage the defences before they are built by travelling back in time to plant delayed-action bombs at strategic places! Your adventure starts in the present day when, innocently attempting to avoid your boss at work, you stumble across a secret passage that transports you 'back in time' to the start of a quest that takes you into the Middle Ages, Prehistoric Times, and the distant future. ❞
