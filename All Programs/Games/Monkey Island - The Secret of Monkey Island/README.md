# The Secret of Monkey Island

「**Mutiny on Monkey Island**」「**Monkey Island 1**」

> ❝ Welcome to the Port of Melee, Mr Guybrush Threepwood. So you think you've got what it takes to be a swashbucklin', bloodthirsty pirate like the rest of us? Do you think a young swabby like yourself to be the first to tame mysterious Monkey Island? Well, laddy, there's more to being a buccaneer than just swinging a sword and swillin' gallons of Grog. First, you got to pass the Seadog test. Good luck! You are going to need it. ❞
