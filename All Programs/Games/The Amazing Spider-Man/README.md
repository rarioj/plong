# The Amazing Spider-Man

> ❝ The evil Mysterio is a master of illusions and Hollywood special effects. When he lures Spider-Man into a movie studio to rescue Mary Jane Parker, he has Spider-Man right where he wants him! Spider-Man is fighting on Mysterio’s turf — six movie sets packed with robots, electrified floors, doors that aren’t there and walls coated with a chemical that keeps Spidey’s webs from sticking! Mysterio has even turned gravity upside-down and sideways in some of his scenes! ❞
