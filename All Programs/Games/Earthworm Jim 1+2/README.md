> ❝ Earthworm Jim, a spineless superhero, wriggles back into action as the Groovy Guardian of Goodness in an incredible journey of cheese-curdling proportions. Left unconscious by a massive cow-induced blow to the head and clad in his indestructible, high-tech super suit, Earthworm Jim continues the battle for truth, justice and well-aerated soil. He sure needs you through his 3D fun house of a brain. But beware, there is an evil lurking, a presence in his mind, a dark unseen force at work - Jim's brain is a dangerous place! Whacked-Out Environments: Enter Jim's psyche, where he comes face to face with his fears, happiness, memories and fantasies. ❞ — *Earthworm Jim*

Saving cows, thwarting lawyers and outsmarting Psy-Crow are all in a day's work for Jim. Are you up to the challenge? Can you handle the awesome new weapons? Excellent! Then stop reading this.
