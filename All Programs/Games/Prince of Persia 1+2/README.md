> ❝ While the sultan is fighting a war in a foreign land, his vizier Jaffar, a wizard, seizes power. His only obstacle to the throne is the sultan's daughter. Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she dies within 60 minutes. You are thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. To free her, you must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. ❞ — *Prince of Persia*
>
> ❝ The evil magician Jaffar assumes your identity, steals your beloved princess, and casts you out of the palace as a beggar. With ferocious palace guards in pursuit, you flee from rooftop to rooftop, through caverns, across a desert island, passed into ruins and beyond. ❞ — *Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame*
