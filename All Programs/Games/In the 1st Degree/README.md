# In the 1st Degree

> ❝ Someone is dead. Someone is lying. Can you prove Murder One? Some artists die for their art. James Tobin killed, or did he? As a D.A. in San Francisco, you must prove that he did. It has become the most sensational murder case to hit the Bay Area in years. Who will lead you to the truth? The passionate girlfriend of the accused? The socially connected wife of the victim? Perhaps his bitter apprentice? Every reluctant witness and shred of evidence may paint a homicidal portrait as chilling and surreal as one of Tobin's paintings. And as if that were not enough, everyone will be watching you on this one, especially the media. ❞
