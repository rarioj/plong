# Where's Waldo? At the Circus

> ❝ As the title suggests, Waldo is at the circus now. We will play several mini-games besides the most obvious one: searching for Waldo hidden in the pictures depicting crowds on the circus grounds. We have several tasks to do while helping some other characters, like a lion tamer or a clown. ❞
