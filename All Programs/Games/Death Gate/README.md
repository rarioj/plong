Since then, generations of defeated Patryns have survived bleak existence in the nightmarish prison of the Labyrinth. But now, one man discovers the Death Gate, a treacherous crossing that leads to freedom. His quest: to recover the scattered pieces of the World Seal, wreak his revenge and deliver his people into independence. ❞
