# Diablo + Hellfire

「**Diablo** (Base)」「**Diablo: Hellfire** (Add-on)」

> ❝ Vengeance, power, intellect and magic are the tools you will need to battle the Lord of All Evil, Diablo. Embark, if you dare, upon a dark and sinister quest that will pull you into the very depths of Hell itself and beyond. ❞ — *Diablo*
>
> ❝ Hellfire introduces players to new quests revolving around a powerful demon known as Na-Krul. A creature who once served as Diablo's chief minion and ally, Na-Krul and his cohorts rebelled against Diablo and, after a failed attempt to overthrow their master, were banished to the Void. Freed by an evil sorcerer, Na-Krul has set up command in the ancient Demon Crypts and has once again started his plans to destroy Diablo and spread the evils of Hell throughout the world. Gathering together a small army of never-before-seen monsters, Na-Krul poses an even more threat than Diablo. ❞ — *Hellfire*
