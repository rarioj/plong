# Frankenstein: Through the Eyes of the Monster

> ❝ Between life and death, man and monster, lies the test of the human heart. With a crash of lightning, you are reborn to a world of haunted memories and science pushed beyond the bounds of nature. Your thoughts come slowly like distant echoes. The mystery of your existence pulls at your mind: An ancient castle of dark secrets and hidden terrors; A strange crystal glows with life itself. The burning memory of a child long thought dead and a discovery that crosses the boundaries between life and death. ❞
