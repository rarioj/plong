# Return of the Phantom

> ❝ The story begins in the summer of 1993. You are Inspector Raoul Montand, visiting the famed Paris Opera House to attend the premiere of the legendary Don Juan Triumphant, supposedly composed by Erik, the Phantom of the Opera. But a ghastly accident stops the production before it starts, and all the evidence seems to indicate the Phantom himself is still alive! Then things take a truly bizarre twist. While investigating the crime, you are pushed from a catwalk by an unseen assailant and plunged backward in time to 1881! Suddenly, everyone believes you are Raoul de Chagny, lover of the beautiful opera singer Christine Daae, and rival to the real Phantom of the Opera. ❞
