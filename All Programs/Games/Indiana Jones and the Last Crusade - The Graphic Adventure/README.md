> ❝ Europe, 1938. The Lost Ark was just a warm-up! Now Adolph Hitler is after the most powerful talisman of all - the Holy Grail. A few brave men stand in his way. Fortunately, one of them is Indiana Jones, and he has his dad with him. The bad guys are in your face - mercenaries, traitors, and spies. Not to mention everything the Luftwaffe can throw at you. Can you handle the heat? If you can, you might earn a higher I.Q. (Indy Quotient) then the man with the whip and the hat. ❞
