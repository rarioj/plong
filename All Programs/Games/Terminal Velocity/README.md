# Terminal Velocity

「**Velocity Brawl**」

> ❝ In the far future, armadas from surrounding systems have suddenly waged war on Earth, destroying critical installations and major cities. Earth is now on its knees. You are a pilot from the Ares Squadron flying the fastest, most dangerous crafts ever made. Currently, you are in the TV-202, a fighter few can handle. Given that the previous model, the TV-101, has chalked up more dead pilots than any experimental craft in history, many consider you lucky to be alive. You are in a flying coffin, outgunned and outmanned. But think how good a Saved-the-Known-Galaxy title will look on your resume. ❞
