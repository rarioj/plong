# Shannara

> ❝ Brona, the ancient Warlock King, has returned! Slain decades ago, Brona's evil spirit has returned to wreak revenge upon those who killed him. Now, only the combined magic of the races can destroy him. You are Jak Ohmsford. Only you can overcome the ancestral hatreds that divide the Four Lands. And only you can wield the magic that will defeat Brona. It is your destiny to save your homeland-but the price is far higher than you could have ever imagined. ❞
