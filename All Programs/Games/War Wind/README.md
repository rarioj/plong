> ❝ Centuries of oppression have plagued the ancient world of Yavaun, and the time has come to put the tyranny to an end! Four unique races inhabit this war-torn alien world, each with its strengths, weaknesses and distinctive A.I. You will experience their epic struggle first-hand. Learn about each race's plight through dozens of spell-binding 3D cinematics and pledge your allegiance to the mentally astute Tha'Roon, the combat-driven Obblinox, the industrious Eaggra, or the mystical Shama'Li. ❞
