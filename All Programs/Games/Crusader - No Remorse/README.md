# Crusader: No Remorse

> ❝ As a Silencer, one of the elite enforcers of the World Economic Consortium, you're supposed to be incorruptible. But if the system you serve is utterly corrupt, where does that leave you? You go to the Resistance, the same pack you used to hunt down. Your former employers better watch their backs because you're coming after them with all the firepower at your command - No pity, no mercy, no remorse. ❞
