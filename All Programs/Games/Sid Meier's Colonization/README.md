# Sid Meier's Colonization

「**Colonization**」「**Sid Meier's Colonization: Create A New Nation**」

> ❝ Before you lie the promise that is the New World with all its peril and infinite possibility. Vast, lush green tracts of forest; freezing, crystal clear mountain rivers; plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Be its master! Colonization from Sid Meier is a story of discovery, exploration and territorial independence. Play the colonist, conquistador and diplomat facing the challenges and frustrations of building a new independent nation. Choose the European power you want to represent: French, Spanish, Dutch, or British. Use the wealth of the land to build up your position. Use deceit and force to outwit rivals. Use trade alliances to forge friendships and create new industries - all while holding back the possibility of revolt. ❞
