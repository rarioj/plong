# Lighthouse: The Dark Being

> ❝ Pass through a shimmering portal into a world teeming with invention, discovery, and evil. Dark Being terrorized a parallel universe. Alien technology, unearthly treachery, and brain-twisting danger skulk around every craggy cliff and corner. Lives and worlds hang in the balance. Dr. Jeremiah Krick summoned you on a rescue mission. Do you have the courage and the imagination to leave your world and enter the unknown? You are the beacon of hope in a strange and barren world. ❞
