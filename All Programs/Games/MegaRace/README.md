# MegaRace

> ❝ This race is so full of sound and fury, so graphic and realistic that you will squirm in your seat as you squeal around futuristic 3-0 cities in custom war wagons loaded with weapons. You'll have so much fun so fast it will make your head spin. Remember, your life depends on speed, cunning, and aggression. And you're going to need them all. You can't avoid tricky scum like Hammerhead and King Kool as their gangs try to take you out. But if you knock them off first, you can grab their guns and get going on the ride of your life. It's do or die. You haven't seen anything like this because there's never been anything like MegaRace. Strap yourself into this brave new world of battle racing and take it to the limit! ❞
