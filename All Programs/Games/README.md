> ❝ The year is 1910. Bathed in pale Spring sunlight, the small fishing port of Illsmouth is a sleepy New England town where time seems to stand still. Appearances can be very deceiving, however. Beneath the peaceful tranquillity of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers. Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley Comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one speaks of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients. ❞

> ❝ It's 2039, six years after solving the Linsky murder case. The years have been less than kind to Tex Murphy. In post-holocaust San Francisco, he has been into constant radiation, but what's put the lines in his face are the years trying to stay afloat and recapture the glory of his first big case. While working on his first case, Tex stumbled into - and foiled - a conspiracy to dominate the world. Since then, he's been high and dry, trying to keep from being broke. Understandably, he jumps at an offer by the powerful Marshall Alexander. ❞

Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink. Once the wayward asteroid is in a safe orbit, they examine the asteroid's rocky surface. What they uncover is anything but routine. Low, Brink, and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The spacecraft transported them across the galaxy to a desolate planet, Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels. But no Cocytans. Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich-empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unravelling in the face of such uncertainty? To return to Earth, they must dig for answers on the planet's surface and deep within themselves. ❞

> ❝ You control XCom, an organization formed by the world's governments to fight the ever-increasing alien menace. Shooting down UFOs is just the beginning. You lead a squad of heavily-armed soldiers across different terrains as they investigate the UFO crash site. Tackle the aliens with automatic rifles, rocket launchers and even tanks in the struggle to retrieve useful technology, weapons or life forms. Successful ground assault missions will allow XCom scientists to analyze alien items. Each breakthrough brings you closer to understanding the technology and culture of the alien races. When your engineers have amassed sufficient research data on their superior weapons and craft, they'll be available for your troops. ❞

> ❝ Awakened by the cosmic emissions of their brothers, the vast chambers of innumerable species begin their re-animation cycle. XCom must face a new terror, an army of aliens but in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on men in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world and use new technology. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares. A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the vessel T'leth crash-landed on Earth some sixty-five million years ago, the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons, computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt colonization, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite. ❞
