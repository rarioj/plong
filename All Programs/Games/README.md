> ❝ Hellfire introduces players to new quests revolving around a powerful demon known as Na-Krul. A creature who once served as Diablo's chief minion and ally, Na-Krul and his cohorts rebelled against Diablo and, after a failed attempt to overthrow their master, were banished to the Void. Freed by an evil sorcerer, Na-Krul has set up command in the ancient Demon Crypts and has once again started his plans to destroy Diablo and spread the evils of Hell throughout the world. Gathering together a small army of never-before-seen monsters, Na-Krul poses an even more threat than Diablo. ❞ — *Hellfire*

> ❝ You will find wizards, dragons, heroes, and household hygiene specialists. There is danger here, but there is also custard around the place. Discworld is a fantasy world with a low reality threshold. The real world keeps on breaking through, but Discworld changes it. However, because it is a fantasy world, there are some things that it has to have, and one of them is a certain tendency to experience some trouble with dragons. Unfortunately, a dragon is now ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the world's leading city. Many people consider this a civic improvement, but Ankh-Morpork needs a hero. All they have, however, is Rincewind, a wizard whose only talent is that he is not, in fact, dead yet. He also has the Luggage, the nastiest piece of travelware in the universe. With that at his side, there is probably no limit to things he can fail to do. Oh, did I say he? I meant you. ❞

Worse, many corrupt wizards began turning to mana for their nefarious purposes, eventually leading to war. The battling wizards began using more destructive spells and summoning deadly monsters, which often turned against them. One wizard hoped to end everything with an all-powerful magic spell but instead only left the worlds shattered. Only his apprentice survived. His goal is to restore the world to equilibrium. ❞

Vast, lush green tracts of forest; freezing, crystal clear mountain rivers; plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Be its master! Colonization by Sid Meier is a story of discovery, exploration and territorial independence. Play the colonist, conquistador and diplomat facing the challenges and frustrations of building a new independent nation. Choose the European power you want to represent: French, Spanish, Dutch, or British. Use the wealth of the land to build up your position. Use deceit and force to outwit rivals.
