# Superhero League of Hoboken

> ❝ The United States is a nightmare land of toxic waste, melted ice caps, and desperate shortages of oat bran. Horrible mutations roam the countryside, monsters spawned by radiation, environmental toxins, and unregulated bioengineering. But in a tiny corner of New Jersey, a small group of Superheroes has banded together. Their mission is to nurture the rebirth of a new society, to ease the suffering of the dark age, and to provide a place where Superheroes can always find a date on Saturday night. ❞
