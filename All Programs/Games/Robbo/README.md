# Robbo

「**Adventures of Robbo**」

> ❝ After pulling too many mischievous pranks, Robbo found himself destined to live in a horrid maze designed to prevent the intelligent little robot from escaping. It is up to you to end Robbo's frustration and torture and find a way to freedom. Beware! Along the way, you will encounter giant spiders blocking the corridors, powerful cannons shooting missiles in random directions, and deadly electromagnets designed to destroy all metal objects, including Robbo! That is just the beginning. ❞
