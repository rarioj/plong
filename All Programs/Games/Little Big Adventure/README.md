> ❝ Chilling dreams of destruction and doom fill your mind. You feel compelled to warn the world. In doing so, the tyrannous Dr. Funfrock imprisoned you. Are you in prison because of a dream? You know in your soul that you must escape somehow and discover the meaning behind this mystery. As Twinsen, prophet and saviour, you embark on a surreal and suspenseful journey. You cross continents to save the world and stop your evil nemesis. Your enemies may overtake you at any moment. Relentless you must be, for only those who remain pure can overcome the peril that awaits. ❞
