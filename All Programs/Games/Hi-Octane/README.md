# Hi-Octane

「**Hi-Octane: The Track Fights Back**」

> ❝ Racers drive to their death on the bleak streets of the 21st century. Hi-Octane puts you behind the wheel of an armour-plated Hov-Car capable of 400+mph. Race through city streets, open wastelands or deserts faster than a Ferrari and with accessories you'd never find on a Volvo (like a missile launcher and chain gun). If anyone gets in your way, remember your highway code: Mirror. Signal. Fire! ❞
