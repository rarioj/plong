# Sanitarium

> ❝ Spiralling upwards out of the vacuum, you open your eyes and struggle to comprehend your environment. Underneath you, the springs of an institutional cot sink almost to the floor. The mattress is roughly the thickness of a paper towel and reeks of affliction. Vague memories assault you, a hurried phone call, a message of utmost importance, and a car losing control. As you wake up with a throbbing head, you hear people screaming, sobbing, laughing manically in the background. Is it a nightmare? Are you insane? Is it a reality? Maybe this is death. ❞
