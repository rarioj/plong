「**Cyberia: -experience the future-**」

> ❝ In a future where global terrorists rule and mankind lives on the brink of destruction, the ultimate doomsday device has just been discovered beneath the frozen wasteland of the Northern Asia. Codenamed Cyberia, it was designed in an era of long forgotten peace by the most brilliant minds in nano and cybernetic technology. In an ancient world of hope, it was to be the ultimate protector of a new order. In 2027, it stands as the instrument of humanity's destruction. ❞
