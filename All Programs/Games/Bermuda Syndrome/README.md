# Bermuda Syndrome

> ❝ You are Jack J. Thompson. Destiny has brought you here. It's 1942. Shot down in the region of the infamous Bermuda Triangle, our hero has crash-landed into a dense tropical jungle and a whole heap of trouble. Are you a god? It is more than divine intervention to fend off attacks from restless natives and ferocious dinosaurs, save a distressed damsel from a fate worse than death, and escape this insanity to return home. There's no time to party. Sharp reflexes and lateral thinking are essential if Jack is to escape from this land that time doesn't even know about. It is not a holiday resort. ❞
