# Descent: Anniversary Edition

「**Descent** (Base)」「**Descent: Levels of the World** (Add-on)」「**Inferno**」

> ❝ You begin deep below the surface of Lunar Base I, where an unknown alien race has taken over the chasm of the Post-Terran Mining Corporation. Lunge down mine shafts, twist around never-ending tunnels and fight past robotic menaces in a 360° 3D environment. Move up, move down, shoot everything everywhere. Hang onto your senses (and your lunch) as you drop down mine shafts on a ride that'll leave you spinning. ❞
