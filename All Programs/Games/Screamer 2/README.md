# Screamer 2

「**Screamer 2: Sheer Speed Road Racing**」「**S2**」

> ❝ This all-new landmark in driving experiences leaves even its impressive, critically acclaimed predecessors eating dirt. For the first time, six formidable courses from around the world have been designed with variable conditions to put the best to the test. Feel every bone-shaking bump, every nerve-wracking jump, every mud- and gut-churning skid, twist and turn. But don't feel ashamed to release the tension with a scream every once in a while. ❞
